# Password Generator and Strength Checker

This project is a web-based application that generates secure, random passwords and provides real-time feedback on their strength. It aims to help users create strong passwords that enhance their online security.

## Features

- **Generate Password:** Click the "Generate Password" button to create a new random password.
- **Password Strength Checker:** Real-time feedback on the strength of the password as you type or generate a new password.
- **Toggle Visibility:** Click the eye icon to toggle the visibility of the password between plain text and hidden.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** For styling the web page.
- **JavaScript:** For the functionality of generating passwords and checking their strength.

## Usage

1. **Generate a Password:**
   - Open the application in a web browser.
   - Click the "Generate Password" button to create a new password.
   
2. **Check Password Strength:**
   - The strength of the password will be displayed as "weak," "medium," or "strong" based on its length and complexity.
   
3. **Toggle Password Visibility:**
   - Click the eye icon to show or hide the password.

## How It Works

- **Password Generation:**
  - The password is generated using a mix of [uppercase letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case), [lowercase letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case), [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerals), and [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_character).
  - A minimum length of 12 characters ensures a reasonably strong password.
  
- **Password Strength Checking:**
  - The strength checker evaluates the password based on its length:
    - **Weak:** Less than 4 characters.
    - **Medium:** Between 4 and 8 characters.
    - **Strong:** 8 or more characters.
  
- **Visibility Toggle:**
  - The eye icon allows users to toggle the password field between visible and hidden states, making it easier to confirm the generated password.
